					<h4>Pottery Canyon</h4>
					<p>This sort of adventure you can explore enroute to something else. It doesn't require packing up a backpack, water for the day or sunscreen.</p>
					<p> It also doesn't require a tank of gas or a Thomas Bros. guide. It does require you to stop and take notice, listen to the silence, check out a piece of of history, appreciate a gem amidst the urban sprawl and then get on with whatever you've got going.</p>
					<p>This "tip" is good for anyone with small children whom you'd like to introduce to trails and basic natural environments.</p>
					<p>Just off La Jolla Parkway which runs into La Jolla, make a right turn on Torrey Pines Road. At the first major signal, make a quick and hard right turn on Pottery Canyon Driveway. </p>
					<p>Drive slowly onto the property. Follow the paved road until you arrive at the small dirt parking area. Look carefully along the way because you might find some four-legged friends you'd least expect to see in La Jolla. No, we can't give it away. We take the 5th. </p>
					<p>In 2012, construction has been underway for new digs on the property. </p>
					<p>You have entered a special place of 18.8 acres of public open space with towering eucalyptus trees. You'll see the private home of some "lucky duck" who shares access to the property. </p>
					<p>The canyon trail is very short at 1/5th-mile. That is not a 'typo'. The tiny trail is only 1/5th-mile. Maybe it isn't suitable for the Siera Club Master Hike Committee, but it is perfect for children or for pulling off the beaten path once in awhile and getting a quick injection of nature.</p>
					<p> It is long enough to step off from the world. It is short enough and close enough to city life to do it often.
					</p>
					<p>In 1928, two brothers from Jalisco, Mexico migrated to the U.S. to look for a place that they could use for pottery making. </p>
					<p>They found what San Diegans know so very well today, the San Diego soil is rich with clay. Good for pottery. Bad for modern day landscaping.</p>
					<p>The guys bought the property, built their homes and developed a thriving business known as the La Jolla Canyon Clay Products Company.
						<p> Look at the rooftops of many of the old Spanish-style buildings in San Diego and you'd be safe to assume these guys produced some of the red clay tiles.</p>
						<p> For over 20 years, their hands created handmade roof and floor tiles, adobe and other clay products. They stayed in the canyon for the remainder of their lives.</p>
						<p>Pottery Canyon received San Diego Historic Landmark designation back in 1976. To see some neat old photos, you'll need to follow us!</p>
						<h4>Personal Experience</h4>
						<p> Go for the history, not for an amazing hike. Go in the springtime (which I did not) and I can guarantee it to be green and flowery (I saw the dying nastursiums so I know it gets pretty during this time). </p>
						<p>It is very quiet and isolated out here so if you want peace and quiet, this is a good place to go.</p>
