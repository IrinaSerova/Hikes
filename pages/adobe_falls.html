					<h4>Personal Experience</h4>
					<p>In my opinion, and especially for San Diego, this is a legitimate waterfall.</p>
					<p> The scores of graffiti adds an interesting, urban touch which is sad (not only because the graffiti is pretty terrible) but also colorful and slightly surreal. </p>
					<p>I guess that's what happens when a waterfall is easily accessible and neighbors a college town. This is one of the only non-seasonal waterfalls in San Diego. </p>
					<p>Alvarado Creek draws its water from much of Del Cerro, San Carlos, Fletcher Hills, Grossmont and some of the hilly areas south of the I-8 corridor from Grossmont west until Fairmount Ave. </p>
					<p>I am opposed to graffiti, especially along hiking trails. However, there is something artistic about the extravagant designs scattered across Adobe Falls.</p>
					<p> This graffiti-covered hike is next to San Diego State University and in the middle of a residential neighborhood, yet you wouldn’t even know it unless you’ve heard about it through word of mouth or online.</p>
					<p> Adobe Falls, as the name suggests, is a small waterfall colliding down heavily vandalized rocks. The bright colors sprayed across the landscape provide for a visually stimulating environment, albeit again I don’t condone graffiti in an urban or natural environment. </p>
					<p>Unfortunately this hike is easily accessible, short and in close proximity to a college town – equaling a recipe for disaster.</p>
					<p>Adobe Falls is also one of the only non-seasonal waterfalls in San Diego, flowing year-round. </p>
					<p>Alvarado Creek draws its water from much of Del Cerro, San Carlos, Fletcher Hills, Grossmont, and some other hilly areas south of the Interstate 8 corridor from Grossmont west until Fairmont Avenue to provide this always flowing treasure. </p>
					<p>This short trail is located just a ten minute drive off the freeway. </p>
					<p>You’d never know to look for it here: there are no signs, no indication of hiking trails nearby, and it is literally in the middle of suburbia. </p>
					<p> However, there is a street named after these falls and an apartment complex nearby conveniently named Adobe Falls, both of which suggest you are close to your destination. </p>
					<p> At the bottom of a steep hill, past a “No Trespassing” sign, you will walk down loose terrain, veer left and cross a small stream to reach Adobe Falls. </p>
					<p>From here the trail opens wide, and San Diego State University and the I-8 freeway will appear in the distance.
					</p>
					<p>Shortly after, you will see the falls, and likely a plethora of garbage. I’ve come across empty and broken alcohol bottles, empty bottles of spray paint, and bags of chips just to name a few things discarded here. </p>
					<p>
						Unfortunately, many have taken advantage of this site by not only defacing the natural habitat but also leaving behind litter.</p>
